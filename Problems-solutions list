Understandability and extendability of the code for other developers 
1. Spagetti code
2. Underusage of the drupal inner functions

front-end
1. No way of seeing the execution of JS code step by step -- debugger by chrome dev tools
2. No way of checking if the code is secure enough --
3. No readablity of the (drupal) JS code -- Parsed code into functions, applied drupal js methods, made readable and shorter,
4. No control over the amount of ajax calls sent(2 extra ajax call occur when trying to send only one)  --
5.

back-end
1. No way of seeing the execution of PHP code step by step -- Xdebug for netbaens
2. No way of checking if the code is secure enough --
3. No structure to theme's .tpl files -- Brought to standards 
4. No structure to modules folder -- Brought to standards 
5. No deletion of  modules unneeded by the main features -- Deleted->back uped->tested->deleted
6. No control of logging
7. No hook form alter for forms, only self-written forms
8.

Optimization and speed of execution
1. Long time of the page load --  
2. Page runs slowly for the first time -- special cron job
3. Ajax requests execute very slowly up to 10 secocnd -- JS module
4. No way of tracking of the execution of different functions -- https://trello.com/c/WI4vYZhw/263-timesheets-page-learn-what-time-is-requiered-for-1-forming-page-2-downloading-page-3-executing-js-4-executing-ajax 

front-end
1. No picking of the best cdn provider and compression of libraries -- JSUpdate 
2. No browser cache leverage -- htaccess update
3. No gzip compression -- https://www.drupal.org/project/boost
4. No use of lazy loading for site assets.
5. No asynchronous Downloading of 3rd party scripts
6. No Use of efficient CSS selectors.
7. No removal of unused css
8. No image optimization 
9. Make sure all cache tables are clearing properly especially cache_form
10.

back-end
1. No aggregation of js and css files  -- set in development settings
2. No setup or control of cron jobs at all -- set cron jobs which...
3. No caching of pages and blocks -- set in development settings
4. No caching optimizations 
5. No db maintance 
6. No deletion of  modules unneeded by the main features -- Deleted->back uped->tested->deleted
7. a lot of indention in .tpl files
8. No manual reduce of the size of css files.
